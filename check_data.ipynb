I\\'m your host, Cian Prendergast, and today we\\'re going to talk about one of the most exciting topics in AI: low-resource language models. Joining me is a special guest, who\\'s an expert in this field and has worked with some of the biggest names in tech. Let\\'s get started!\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (excitedly) Oh, wow, Cian, I\\'ve been following your work, and I have to say, it\\'s amazing. I\\'m a huge fan of your research on low-resource language models. Can you tell us a little bit about what inspired you to get into this field?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (smiling) Ah, thanks for the kind words. I think what inspired me was the realization that most AI models are trained on massive datasets from developed countries, which can make them inaccessible to people from other parts of the world. I wanted to create a model that could work with limited data, which would make it more inclusive and democratic. So, I started exploring low-resource language models, and I\\'ve been hooked ever since.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (interrupting) Hmm, that\\'s a great point, Cian. And I\\'ve heard that you\\'ve developed a bilingual LLM using legislative data sources. Can you tell us more about that project?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (launching into a detailed explanation) Ah, yes, the Irish-English bilingual LLM. So, the idea was to create a model that could understand and generate text in both languages, using data from Irish legislation. We used a combination of BERT and Llama2-13B to fine-tune the model, and we were able to achieve some really impressive results. (pauses for a brief moment) But, the interesting thing about this project is that it\\'s a great example of how low-resource language models can be used to improve language understanding and generation, even with limited data.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (excitedly) Wow, that sounds like a really cool project. And I have to ask, how do you think this kind of model could be used in real-world applications?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (smiling) Ah, that\\'s a great question. I think the possibilities are endless. For example, we could use this model to create chatbots that can understand and respond to users in multiple languages, or to develop language learning tools that can help people improve their language skills. The possibilities are really exciting.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (interrupting) Umm, that\\'s really cool. And I\\'ve heard that you\\'ve also worked on a project called RAG-Bot, which uses a RAG architecture with FAISS vector search. Can you tell us more about that?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (launching into a detailed explanation) Ah, yes, RAG-Bot. So, the idea behind this project was to create a conversational AI advisor that could understand and respond to users in a more empathetic and contextual way. We used a combination of RAG architecture and FAISS vector search to create a model that could retrieve relevant information from a large dataset of advice columns. (pauses for a brief moment) And the interesting thing about this project is that it\\'s a great example of how low-resource language models can be used to create more human-like and empathetic AI systems.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (excitedly) That sounds like a really interesting project. And I have to ask, what\\'s the biggest challenge you faced when working on RAG-Bot?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (smiling) Ah, that\\'s a great question. I think the biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the model understand the context of the user\\'s query. It\\'s one thing to retrieve relevant information from a dataset, but it\\'s another thing entirely to make the model understand what the user is actually asking for. (pauses for a brief moment) But, after a lot of experimentation and tuning, we were able to achieve some really impressive results.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (interrupting) Hmm, that\\'s really interesting. And I\\'ve heard that you\\'ve also written a research paper on ML adoption strategies for Dell. Can you tell us more about that?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (launching into a detailed explanation) Ah, yes, the research paper. So, the idea behind this paper was to propose a novel bottom-up approach for fostering AI innovation through employee-led projects. We used a combination of data analysis and machine learning to identify the key factors that contribute to successful AI adoption, and we were able to develop a framework for implementing these strategies in real-world settings. (pauses for a brief moment) And the interesting thing about this research is that it\\'s a great example of how AI can be used to drive business innovation and growth.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (excitedly) That sounds like a really interesting paper. And I have to ask, what\\'s the biggest takeaway from this research?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (smiling) Ah, that\\'s a great question. I think the biggest takeaway is that AI adoption is not just about technology; it\\'s about creating a culture of innovation and experimentation within an organization. By empowering employees to take ownership of AI projects and providing them with the necessary resources and support, companies can create a sustainable and effective AI adoption strategy.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (interrupting) Hmm, that\\'s really insightful. And I think that\\'s a great place to wrap up today\\'s episode of Tech Talk. Cian, thanks so much for joining us and sharing your expertise with us.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: (smiling) Ah, thanks for having me. It\\'s been a pleasure to talk about low-resource language models and AI adoption strategies with you.\\n\\nSpeaker 2: (excitedly) And to our listeners, thanks for tuning in to this episode of Tech Talk.
